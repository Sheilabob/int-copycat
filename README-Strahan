This page was designed based on the test.fig design file, focusing only on the 3B - Results page.

It is responsive and ready for a frontend engineer to start adding interactivity and API functionality.

No external frameworks or libraries were used - it is all vanilla CSS and HTML.

There are links to relevant Google fonts and icons. 3 downloaded logo files are included.
